The font is an unchanged test fixture. It was not subsetted, hinted,
normalized, or regenerated.

## Independent shaping oracle

The expectations were produced outside the implementation under test by an
external C ABI audit probe linked with HarfBuzz `14.3.0`, against this exact
TTF. The `ffi` request used LTR, `Latn`, `en`, BiDi level `0`, BOT/EOT, the
pinned HarfBuzz feature policy, and a layout size of `1000`:

```text
glyphs: [6631]
advance: [795]
GDEF ligature carets: AVAILABLE, logical boundaries [1, 2], positions [269, 537]
```

This oracle is fixed fixture data. The test calls the Kotlin backend once and
compares its result with these constants; it neither invokes a second
HarfBuzz call nor uses the backend under test as an oracle.

## Multiscript fallback oracle

The Arabic portion of the mixed Latin/Arabic consumer scenario was separately
audited with the unchanged checked-in TTF and `hb-shape 14.4.0`:

```sh
hb-shape --direction=rtl --script=Arab --language=ar --no-glyph-names \
  Amiri-Regular.ttf 'سلام'
```

```text
[85=3+452|3080=2+446|3075=1+245|1919=0+568]
```

The expected glyph identifiers, advances, and reverse cluster order in the
consumer test were transcribed from this independent command. A human review
confirmed that the command names the checked-in Amiri artifact, uses Arabic
script and language, and preserves the logical scalar clusters `0` through
`3` while HarfBuzz emits RTL glyph order. The test never runs this command.
